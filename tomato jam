I tried the following with 1kg of tomatoes and 1 tbsp pectin, but the jam didn't solidify...

If you want a thicker, more gel-like tomato jam, you can add pectin to the recipe. Pectin is a natural thickening agent found in some fruits, and it helps achieve a firmer set for jams. Here’s how to incorporate pectin into the tomato jam recipe I provided earlier, along with some guidance:
Updated Tomato Jam Recipe with Pectin
Ingredients:
• 2 lbs (about 1 kg) ripe tomatoes, chopped (Roma or plum tomatoes are ideal)
• 3/4 to 1 cup granulated sugar (adjust based on desired sweetness; pectin works with less sugar than traditional recipes)
• 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
• 1 tsp ground cinnamon
• 1/2 tsp ground ginger
• 1/4 tsp ground cloves
• 1/2 tsp salt
• 1–2 tbsp powdered pectin (use classic pectin, like Sure-Jell or Ball brand, for low-sugar recipes; follow package instructions for exact amount)
• Optional: 1 small chili pepper, finely chopped, or 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for spice
Instructions:
1. Prepare Tomatoes: Wash and chop tomatoes into small pieces. You can peel them for a smoother texture or leave skins on for more texture.
2. Mix Pectin: In a small bowl, mix the powdered pectin with 1/4 cup of the sugar (this prevents clumping when added to the pot).
3. Cook: In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine tomatoes, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and optional chili. Stir over medium heat. Once the mixture is warm, gradually stir in the pectin-sugar mixture.
4. Add Remaining Sugar: After the pectin is fully dissolved (about 1–2 minutes), add the remaining sugar. Stir until dissolved.
5. Boil and Simmer: Bring to a rolling boil (one that doesn’t stop when stirred) for 1–2 minutes, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jam thickens to your desired consistency. Pectin sets faster than a no-pectin recipe, so it won’t need as long to reduce.
6. Test Consistency: Place a small spoonful of jam on a chilled plate and let it cool for a minute. Push it with your finger; it should wrinkle and hold its shape. If it’s too thin, simmer for another 5–10 minutes.
7. Cool and Store: Let the jam cool slightly, then transfer to sterilized jars. Seal and refrigerate for up to 2–3 weeks, or process in a water bath for 10 minutes for longer shelf life (canning).
Yield: About 2–2.5 cups of jam.
Notes on Pectin:
• Type of Pectin: Use classic powdered pectin for this recipe, as it works well with tomatoes’ natural acidity. Liquid pectin can also be used but requires different timing (add it at the end of cooking; follow package instructions).
• Amount: Start with 1 tbsp of powdered pectin for 2 lbs of tomatoes. If you want a very firm set, increase to 1.5–2 tbsp, but check the pectin package for specific ratios based on sugar and fruit amounts.
• Sugar and Pectin: Pectin allows you to use less sugar than traditional jam recipes (which rely on sugar for thickening). Adjust sugar to taste, but ensure it’s within the range recommended by the pectin manufacturer for proper gelling.
• Natural Pectin Alternative: If you prefer not to use commercial pectin, you can add a grated green apple (high in natural pectin) to the recipe and cook it longer, as in the original recipe, but the set will be softer.
Tips:
• Stir frequently to prevent sticking, especially with pectin, as the mixture can thicken quickly.
• If the jam becomes too thick, you can thin it with a splash of water or lemon juice during cooking.
• For a smoother jam, blend the mixture before or after cooking (use an immersion blender for safety).
Let me know if you need help with canning instructions, a specific pectin brand, or a variation (e.g., savory or extra spicy)!
